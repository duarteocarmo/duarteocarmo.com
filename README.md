The repo for my personal website. 

Made with [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican). Deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and served with [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com). 

Bare with me, I'm still working on it. 

## TODO
- title wrapping when on mobile
- date text in end of article
- check mobile usability
- check highlights and consider transition script
- dark mode?
- spacing in bottom
