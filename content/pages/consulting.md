I like helping clients solve challenging problems using Machine Learning, Data, and Software. I'm known to take a  _full-stack_ approach that starts with _people_. I don't believe in building in the basement, but in establishing a true partnership.

Here are some selected problems I've helped solve in the past: 

- A *multi-modal corporate search engine* that helps employees get the information they need, fast
- End-to-end *NLP models that categorize 50M+ professionals*. For a next-gen lead prospecting platform
- A *large-scale end-to-end data pipeline* to analyze text from millions of companies.  Used for ESG reporting
- *AI and Cloud Strategy* for two large public institutions in the Nordics. Conceived, designed, and presented to the board
- An *emotion recognition system* for call centers. Helping call center agents get visibility on the emotion/state of customers
