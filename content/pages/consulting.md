87% of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/" target="_blank">all data science projects fail</a>. 

Yours doesn't have to.

I'm known to take a *full-stack* approach to helping customers solve problems with AI. I pride myself on delivering projects from start to finish. 

Some problems I've helped solve in the past: 

- An *emotion recognition system* for call centres. Helping call center agents get visibility on the emotion/state of customers
- A *large scale end-to-end data pipeline* to analyse text from millions of companies.  Used for ESG reporting
- Web app showing *insights from large amounts of unstructured data*. Used for traffic incident reporting and analysis
- *AI and Cloud Strategy* for two large public institutions in the Nordics. Conceived, designed, and presented to board
