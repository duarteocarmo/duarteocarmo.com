I help clients solve hard problems using Machine Learning, Data, and Software. I'm known to take a  _full-stack_ approach that starts with _people_. I don't believe in building in the basement, but in tackling problems together.

Some problems I've helped solve in the past: 

- Led the development of a healthcare insights platform powered by LLMs, scaling from 100 to 20K global users and growing team from 2 to 15 people
- Developed NLP models categorizing 50M+ professionals for a lead prospecting platform while leading ML/AI team and mentoring junior engineers
- Built AI and Cloud Strategy for two large public institutions in the Nordics. Conceived, designed, and presented to the board
- Built API for multi-modal enterprise search engine integrating 12 NLP/Audio/Video models to unify company-wide resource discovery 
- Spearheaded R&D for state-of-the-art carbon stock segmentation using satellite imagery for climate tech startup - automated entire farm stratification system
