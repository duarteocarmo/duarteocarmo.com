I love helping people solve challenging problems. 

## Data Science and Machine Learning

I have contributed to popular open source projects such as [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) and [PaperMill](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). I often [blog about it](https://duarteocarmo.com/) too. I have developed projects in data and network science for [the European Union](https://thesis.duarteocarmo.com/) that resulted in a [published paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004016251930006X#!). At Jabra, I got to create a new AI based venture, focused on machine learning applied to audio. I'm proficient in Python, and the whole data science stack, as well as web development, and machine learning pipelines. A good portion of my (public) work can be browsed in [GitHub](https://github.com/duarteocarmo). 

## Business and management consulting

I have worked in technology consulting for one of the [Big Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(management_consultancies)) - [BCG](https://bcgplatinion.com/nordics/). I steer critical projects through management ranks, and deliver strong value to clients. I always keep the C-level perspective in anything I do, and put clients first. My experience includes clients in spaces such as Consumer Electronics, Financial Institutions, Digital Marketing shops, among others. I have also created a [crowd sourced deliveries startup](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eguru-delivery-service/), I helped create products for startups in the Boston MA area while working for [Bliss Applications](https://www.blissapplications.com/), and worked for 1.5 years for the Vice President of Strategy at [Jabra](https://jabra.com). 


## Product development and management

I have developed a wide range of touchable prototypes for apps and web interfaces while at [Bliss Applications](https://blissapplications.com) and at my own startup. I have worked as a product manager at [Jabra](https://jabra.com) of one of the best selling hardware products the company produces. I have experience in delivering both hardware and software products - and love "getting sh*t done".
