I help clients solve hard problems using Machine Learning, Data, and Software. I'm known to take a  _full-stack_ approach that starts with _people_. I don't believe in building in the basement, but in tackling problems together.

Some problems I've helped solve in the past: 

- Scaled a healthcare insights platform powered by LLMs from 100 to 20K global users and grew the team from 2 to 15  
- Built NLP models categorizing 50M+ professionals for lead prospecting, while leading the ML/AI team and mentoring engineers  
- Cut pharmaceutical risk review times by 50% by designing and deploying an LLM-based adverse event and compliance detection system  
- Developed an API for a multi-modal enterprise search engine integrating 12 NLP/Audio/Video models for unified resource discovery  
- Automated farm stratification and carbon stock segmentation with state-of-the-art satellite imagery models for a climate tech startup
