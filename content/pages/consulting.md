I help clients solve hard problems using Machine Learning, Data, and Software. I'm known to take a  _full-stack_ approach that starts with _people_. I don't believe in building in the basement, but in establishing a true partnership.

Some problems I've helped solve in the past: 

- Lead the development of a **next generation insights analysis dashboard** for healthcare professionals powered by LLMs.
- Researched and built a **deep-learning model based on satellite imagery** to generate soil profiles for unseen areas
- A **multi-modal corporate search engine** that helps employees get the information they need, fast
- End-to-end **NLP models that categorize 50M+ professionals**. For a next-gen lead prospecting platform
- A **large-scale end-to-end data pipeline** to analyze text from millions of companies.  Used for ESG reporting
- **AI and Cloud Strategy** for two large public institutions in the Nordics. Conceived, designed, and presented to the board
- An **emotion recognition system** for call centers. Helping call center agents get visibility on the emotion/state of customers
