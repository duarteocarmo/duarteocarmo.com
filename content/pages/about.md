slug: about

I have studied in the [Superior Technical Institute of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), in the [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://english.bit.edu.cn/), and in the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english). 

Currently, I'm a consultant/resident hacker at [Jabra](https://jabra.com), where I help build the best headphones in the world. Here, I'm involved in a lot of different areas: product management, strategy, data science, experimentation, and artificial intelligence.  

In the past, I've worked for the [WYGroup](https://www.wygroup.net/), [Bliss Applications](https://www.blissapplications.com/), and [OnLiquid](https://onliquid.com/). 

In my free time you can probably find me learning about new gadgets, [writing some code]({static}/images/code.jpg), [reading](https://github.com/duarteocarmo/my-personal-zen), [taking photos]({static}/images/photos.jpg), and [running]({static}/images/run.jpg).
