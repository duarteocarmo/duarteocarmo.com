Hi, I'm Duarte, 

I'm a technologist, born and raised in sunny Portugal, now based in Copenhagen. My work lies in the intersection of Machine Learning, Data, Software Engineering, and People. I'm in love with Technology, and how it can improve people's lives. 

In the past, I've worked in Consumer Electronics, Public Institutions, Big Three Management Consulting, and Startups. The common thread? Solving problems end-to-end. 

My work is also shaped by my background and education. I've studied at the [Superior Technical Institute of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), the [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://english.bit.edu.cn/), and the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english).

In my free time, you can probably find me learning about new gadgets, [writing code]({static}/images/code.jpg), [reading](https://github.com/duarteocarmo/my-personal-zen), [taking photos]({static}/images/photos.jpg), or [running]({static}/images/run.jpg). 

If you wish to know more about my career, feel free to browse [my resume](/cv.pdf). 

To get in touch, just email me: me@duarteocarmo.com
