Hi, I'm Duarte, 

I'm a consultant/hacker currently working at [BCG Platinion](https://bcgplatinion.com/nordics/) in Copenhagen, Denmark. My work focuses on helping leading businesses solve challenging problems in the areas of Machine Learning & AI, Cloud, IT Infrastructure, Software development, and Cyber Security.

Previously, I've worked for [Jabra](https://jabra.com), helping C-level executives shape the strategy, and creating new AI based ventures. Earlier endeavours include the [WYGroup](https://www.wygroup.net/) &  [Bliss Applications](https://www.blissapplications.com/) where I got to create new start-ups, and helped develop mobile applications using cutting edge technology.

My work is mostly shaped by my background and education. I've studied in the [Superior Technical Institute of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), in the [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://english.bit.edu.cn/), and in the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english).

In my free time you can probably find me learning about new gadgets, [writing code]({static}/images/code.jpg), [reading](https://github.com/duarteocarmo/my-personal-zen), [taking photos]({static}/images/photos.jpg), or [running]({static}/images/run.jpg). 

If you wish to know more about my career, feel free to browse [my resume](/cv.pdf). To get in touch, just email me: me@duarteocarmo.com
