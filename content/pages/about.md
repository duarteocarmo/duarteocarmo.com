Hi there. I'm Duarte (`du-art`).

I'm a technologist, born and raised in sunny Lisbon, now based in Copenhagen. My work lies in the intersection of Machine Learning & AI, Data, Software, and People. I'm in love with Technology, and how it can improve people's lives.

In the past, I've worked in Consumer Electronics, Public Institutions, Big Three Management Consulting, and YC-backed startups. The common thread? Solving _hard_ problems end-to-end.

My work is greatly shaped by my background and education. I've studied at the [Superior Technical Institute of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), the [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://english.bit.edu.cn/), and the [Technical University of Denmark.](https://www.dtu.dk/english)

When I'm not solving hard problems, you can find me geeking out about new gadgets, [writing code]({static}/images/code.jpg), [reading](https://github.com/duarteocarmo/my-personal-zen), [taking photos]({static}/images/photos.jpg), or [running]({static}/images/run.jpg). 

If you want to learn more about my work, you can browse my [resume](/cv.pdf), my [talks](/talks), or my [consulting](/consulting) page.
