Hi, I'm Duarte, 

I'm an advanced Machine Learning Engineer/hacker at [DSB](https://www.dsb.dk/), the largest train operating company in Scandinavia. Here, I'm focusing on scaling up the recently created Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning department. My day-to-day is a mix of strategy, advisory, leadership, technical architecture, and development. 

Previously, I was employed at the [Boston Consulting Group](https://bcgplatinion.com/nordics/), where I helped leading businesses in the areas of AI & ML, Software Development, and Cyber Security. I've also worked for [Jabra](https://jabra.com), helping C-level executives shape the strategy, and creating new AI based ventures. 

Earlier endeavors include the [WYGroup](https://www.wygroup.net/) &  [Bliss Applications](https://www.blissapplications.com/) where I got to create new start-ups, and helped develop mobile applications using cutting edge technology.

My work is also shaped by my background and education. I've studied in the [Superior Technical Institute of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), in the [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://english.bit.edu.cn/), and in the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english).

In my free time you can probably find me learning about new gadgets, [writing code]({static}/images/code.jpg), [reading](https://github.com/duarteocarmo/my-personal-zen), [taking photos]({static}/images/photos.jpg), or [running]({static}/images/run.jpg). 

If you wish to know more about my career, feel free to browse [my resume](/cv.pdf).
