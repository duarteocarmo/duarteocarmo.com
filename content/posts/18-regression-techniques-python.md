*Recently, I have been working on a project for [Dataverz](https://www.dataverz.net/), the company of my ex-thesis supervisor (and regular collaborator) Pedro Parraguez. I was looking at ways of predicting the number of collaborations between COVID-19 researchers. Here's what I learned.*

## The Problem

I started with a table, where in every row, I basically have information on two researchers, and their number of collaborations (or co-authored papers) in COVID-19 related papers. 

Something like this:


| Researcher 1 Name | Researcher 1 Institution        | Researcher 1 Citations | Researcher 2 Name | Researcher 2 Institution | Researcher 2 Citations | Co-authored Papers |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------:|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------:|-------------------:|
| John Taylor       | Technical University of Denmark |                      4 | Frank Geddes      | Oxford University        |                      2 |                  2 |
| Thomas Smith      | Harvard University              |                     15 | John Sailor       | University of Lisbon     |                      2 |                  1 |
| Thomas Cook       | Harvard University              |                     15 | Frank Geddes      | Oxford University        |                      2 |                  1 |
| ...               | ...                             | ...                    | ...               | ...                      | ...                    | ...                |

- small paragraph about data processing and decisions
- google autoML and normal techniques
- Neural Network results.
