I'm a bit of an [iSheep](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=iSheep). I didn't even know that term existed until a colleague used it on me a couple of years ago. But this is not an Apple vs. Windows (vs. Linux) post. I like my Mac, you might prefer your Windows or Linux machine - that's fine. This post focuses on Mac apps.

I've worked remotely for almost 3 years now - and the importance of little things starts showing. Those things that make my day easier, more pleasant, more productive. From the [desk I sit at](/blog/how-to-work-from-home-revisited), to the [editor](/blog/vim-for-python-development-and-not-only) I use, these things *matter*.

There's a certain *magic* to software that makes everyday work just a *little* more enjoyable and productive. Here's a list of apps that help me achieve just that. 

### <a target="_blank" href="https://meetingbar.onrender.com/">MeetingBar</a>
There are few things in life I hate more than an Outlook notification 10 minutes before my next meeting. Especially in a remote setting. Yes, I want to know when the next meeting will take place - but without everything buzzing all the time. MeetinBar does just that. Your next meeting in your menu bar. When it's time - hit your shortcut, hit it, and you're there. 

### <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/">Itsycal</a>
I like Apple's Calendar app (yeah, iSheep - I told you) - but during a workday, often, you just want to check a simple date. "Are you available on the 5th of July?", "What are you doing on week #34?". These are though questions. Itsycal answers all those, right in your menu bar, in a couple of clicks.

### <a target="_blank" href="https://maestral.app/">Maestral</a>
I still use Dropbox. It's not the best Cloud service, but it was the first I used. There's one thing I can't stand though- their Mac app - always trying to push the next big Dropbox thing on me, eating my RAM, or annoying me with pop ups. I *just* want file sync. Maestral is a lightweight and open source alternative client that does Dropbox file sync - and nothing more - without annoying me or eating my RAM. 100% open-source - what an app. 

### <a target="_blank" href="https://abhishekbanthia.com/clocker/">Clocker</a>
Who likes dealing with time zones? I certainly don't. 8AM in Copenhagen, it's 7AM in Lisbon, which in Singapore means...? I have no clue. Clocker solves just that. In a few clicks I can select a time, see what it corresponds to in other time zones, and copy all those to my clipboard. Done. No more timezone hell. 

### <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a>
For years Spotlight search was good enough. Then I started using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), which was pretty awesome. Now I use Raycast, which is even better. I think of it as Spotlight on steroids (I really hate that expression). I can find files super fast, access my clipboard history, search messages on Slack, search my Google Drive, tweet, check my schedule.. You get my point - go give it a shot.  

### <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/insidegui/PodcastMenu">PodcastMenu</a>
[Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) is my favourite podcast app. When working at my desk - I listen to podcasts sometimes, *especially* if I'm doing something repetitive (e.g., bookkeeping for example). PodcastMenu puts Overcast right in my menu bar. I also syncs perfectly with the mobile version - so that I can keep listening my pods when I leave my place.

### <a target="_blank" href="https://textsniper.app/">TextSniper</a>
Someone sends me a bad scan of a document and there's a number I need to copy from it. There's a weird pdf that I need to copy a reference from. What do I do? I used to look at them one-by-one and copy them over. Now.. I just hit CMD+Shift+2 and this uses OCR for me to copy the text from it. This has saved me *at least* an hour of my life. 

### <a target="_blank" href="https://rectangleapp.com/">Rectangle</a>
We agree. Windows management in MacOS is.. Lacking to say the least. For a long time, I used [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) to manage my windows, and I really liked it. Now that Spectacle is not in active development anymore, the predecessor seems to be Rectangle. A free and open-source option, which has served me very well, and I can definetly recommend. 

### <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/exelban/stats">Stats</a>
OK, you don't exactly *need* this one. But I like to glance at my menu bar app to see my RAM, SSD, and CPU stats. Particularly if I'm doing something in the *heavier* side. Stats is a free and open source alternative to the popular [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) - that sticks to the basics. It allows me to customize whatever I want to see in my menu bar and keep an eye on the state of my Mac. 

## Final thoughts

You'll notice that *at least* 7 out 9 applications I mentioned are free *and* open source. Not only that, but the developers are also regularly pushing updates and making these apps better every day. It's incredible how good a product of passion can become. This post is my way of thanking them for their awsome work. Don't forget to also support them.
