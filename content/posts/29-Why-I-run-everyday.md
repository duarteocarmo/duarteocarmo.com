Something fun happened the other day. While at dinner - I asked a co-worker if he did any sports. He answered "Yeah, I run one mile everyday, exactly the same route.". The whole table started laughing. Thinking that here's Duarte running half marathons, he must thing this guy is ridiculous. 

I didn't laugh one bit. In fact, I think the "1 Mile a day" guy is probably one of the smartest of the bunch. And here's why.

For about two years now, I’ve been running everyday. I’m not a professional athlete, or am I training towards a big race day. I have found through the years that running everyday, consistently, improves my mental and physical well being.

Everyone is busy. “I don’t have time”, “It’s impossible”, I’ve heard it all - I don’t buy it. If it was the case, you wouldn’t have time to do your laundry, or even read this small rant. If you want to do something, you make time for it. Lots of times people will come up with excuses as why they can't do something. Truth is, if something is prioritized enough - it will eventually get done. 

Nothing matters more than time - that's our most valuable resource. If someone tries to block your time with something that does not contribute to your end goal, the answer is simple: no thanks. Running allows you to get back your time. Every minute I run, is **my** minute, and nobody else's. And it feels good to allocate time to myself every day. But not every day is easy. 

It's raining. It's cold. My leg hurts. My head hurts. It's too early. There are 1000 reasons why you *shouldn't* go out for a run today. But there's even more reasons why you should. When you think on why you can't do it - also think on how much better you will feel once you've done it. Soon, once you have done it for long enough - you won't be able to sleep without it. 

10K? 5k? 21k? Nobody cares. It doesn't matter. Really, for the first years of running I didn't wear a smartwatch, measured my pace. Why? Because it's not about competing with others, it's about claiming **your** time back. People tend to get overly concerned about times, paces, and distances - trying to use some external motivator so they can get out of the door themselves. Motivation comes from within.

One mile guy got it - the rest of the table didn't.
