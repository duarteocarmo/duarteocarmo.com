Some months ago, I [built](infrequent-tiny-crm.html) a small script to help me stay in touch with those who matter to me. The concept is fairly simple: I want to stay in touch with person _p_ every _t_ period of time. If _t_ has passed, and you haven't talked to _p_, you get a reminder. 

I've been using this script/system for the past 5 months, it has served me well. I've been keeping up with mentors, ex-managers, family, and friends - without much effort. Which is the goal. It's not that I don't like editing a bunch of markdown files every week - but I wanted something _smoother_.

Also, the more I've told people about my system (which is [not even mine](https://sive.rs/hundreds)), the more I've realized that I'm not the only one who needs something like this. Generally, people have a _hard_ time keeping in touch. It's not that we don't care - it's that life gets in the way.

And so I built [infrequent](https://infrequent.app).

Infrequent is a system to stay in touch with those I care about. A system that I built _literally_ for myself, to scratch my own itch. But also a system that I hope helps others out there.

I'm not gonna lie, it's been pretty fun to get back into web development. I love AI&ML, but there's something _special_ about web development. And [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [htmx](htmx.org/), and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) have been a joy to work with. The stack is not straightforward to set up, but once you get going, it's a breeze to work with. Django is an _incredibly_ powerful framework. 

I don't have million-dollar plans for infrequent just yet. For now, I plan to continue using it, and entice others to do so too. I'll keep adding features to it, as mine (and maybe your) needs evolve. Feel free to give it a spin, and don't hesitate to [email me](mailto:me@duarteocarmo.com) if you like it, or think something is missing.
